Na na na
Na na na
Na na na, yeah

She's got the touch I love so much
That's all I ever wanted
(I'm surely God blessed)
Under her spell she had me crushed
I sworn I was anointed
(Got caught by her magic)

She had me drooling for a while
(With her sexual motion)
Like taking candy from a child
(Stuck on her love potion)
I can't believe the changes I've made
Since I met my baby, you know

She drives me crazy
(On and on)
What a beautiful lady
(On and on)
She drives me crazy
(On and on)
And there's no ifs
Nor maybes she goes
(On and on)
Oh, yeah

Like a volcano she erupts
Blowing up my pager
(Every minute every hour)
I realized she likes my stuff
I chose the right flavor
(This moment I may savor)

No I've never trusted pretty smiles
('cause looks are deceiving)
Sexy walk my love profound
(Some pretty girls are misleading)
Lesson learned don't judge a book
By looking at the cover, you know

She drives me crazy
(On and on)
What a beautiful lady
(On and on)
She drives me crazy
(On and on)
And there's no ifs
Nor maybes she goes
(On and on)

She drives me crazy
(On and on)
What a beautiful lady
(On and on)
She drives me crazy
(On and on)
And there's no ifs
Nor maybes
(On and on)
Oh, yeah

My life my time and my heart
I've dedicated to her
(That's the love she wanted)
I'm saying this I'd never starve
'Cause she is my dream maker
(And now we gonna flaunt it)

Thank God I'm stuck with her for life
(She's having my shorty)
Perfect girl for my wife
('cause it's my baby's mommy)
Girls flaunt their best designs
But there was always something missing

She drives me crazy
(On and on)
What a beautiful lady she goes
(On and on)
She drives me crazy
(On and on)
And there's no ifs
Nor maybes
(On and on)

She drives me crazy
(On and on)
What a beautiful lady, yeah
(On and on)
She drives me crazy
(On and on)
And there's no ifs
Nor maybes
(On and on)
She drives me crazy
